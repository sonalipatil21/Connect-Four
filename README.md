# Connect-Four
## Objective
A C++ program to play Connect Four with two players.

## Implementation
This project was broken into two parts. In the first part I built a Board class that allowed two human players to play Connect Four. In the second part I created a Player class that allowed for a computer to join and play Connect Four as a player.
